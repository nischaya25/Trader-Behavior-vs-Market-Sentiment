# Trader-Behavior-vs-Market-Sentiment
This project presents an interactive Trader Behavior Analytics Dashboard built using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly to analyze how market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) influences trader performance and behavior.  The dashboard allows users to explore trading patterns, profitability, and behavioral metrics through dynamic visualizations and filters.
